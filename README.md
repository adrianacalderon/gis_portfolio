# Map Portfolio
Hi! ðŸŒ´

My name is Adriana and I am a Geographer with experience in spatial data science, specializing in water resources management and climate change.

I enjoy creating new maps to explore and highlight the geography of our world using creative techniques and vibrant colors. Iâ€™m also passionate about experimenting with new geospatial data and tools to bring visualizations to life in vivid ways. 

Below is a collection of selected GIS mapping projects ðŸŒŽ
